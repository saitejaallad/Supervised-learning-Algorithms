ðŸ§  Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. This means that for every input, the correct output is already known. The goal is for the model to learn patterns that map inputs to outputs and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts
Labeled Data: The training dataset includes both input features (X) and known target values (y).
Training: The model learns from the data by adjusting its parameters to reduce prediction errors.
Prediction: Once trained, the model can predict outputs for new inputs.
